## Overview

Website that uses the countries API, shows all countries, filters countries by region, allows you to search for countries and shows you the details of each one. As a bonus, it allows you to change the theme between light and dark.

### The challenge

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
